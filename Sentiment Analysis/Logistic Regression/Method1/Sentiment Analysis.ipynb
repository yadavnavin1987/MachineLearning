The foam gasket in the barrell which keeps the poopy smell inside the unit ripped somehow, and it got VERY stinky. HOWEVER, I contacted the manufacturer though their website, and received an email back the same day stating that this was unusual, and that replacement gaskets were on their way to me. They arrived inside of a week and after replacing, it works great again!

Constantly buying expensive refills, emptying it every couple of days, juggling a wiggly baby while trying to open, lift, push, spin, and close the genie was just too much.  Then I was shopping at Babies R Us and in the STORE\\'s changing room is the Diaper Champ.  It was easy, didn\\'t smell, and used regular trash bags.  I was sold.After using the Diaper Champ for 2 months now, I am confident I made the right choice.  Yes, when it gets too full, you have to change the bag or the weight will get stuck (duh!).  Yes, if you don\\'t wrap up the poopy wipies in the dirty diaper, you will have to clean poop from the chute (just wrap it up).  Yes, poop does smell (not like roses), but my daughter\\'s room doesn\\'t smell like poop because the Diaper Champ does a great job of containing odor.  You do need to disenfect it when you change the bag, but I would recommend that with any product that is a holding tank for feces (you have to disinfect your toilets, too).I have recommended the Diaper Champ over the genie to every one of my friends.  It is fantastic!!</th>\n",

We love that it uses regular kitchen trash bags, makes it much more economical.  We have not found that we need to worry about frequent emptying or cleaning.  We just leave the Champ to do its job until the mechanism begins to feel like it\\'s getting stuck...then we change the bag.  For us this means about once a week.  Not only is the Champ EASY to use, it\\'s kind of fun.  Before our daughter was born we really worried about whether the diaper pail we chose would be effective enough for us because my husband is so sensitive to smells.  But she\\'s two months old now and we still just can\\'t say enough good things about it.UPDATE:  My daughter is now 9 months old and we STILL love our Diaper Champ.  She\\'s eating solid foods, diapers are smellier, but the Champ is still doing it\\'s job.  We empty once a week and spray with Lysol.  Yes, there is an odor when changing the bag, but we take the bag directly out to the trash, spray Champ with Lysol, insert new bag and close the thing back up.  Everything is just fine after that.

When releasing the latch (which is, wonderfully, a one-handed job, although it can be a tad bit difficult to squeeze), it springs open rather sharply. I have short nails but I can imagine long nails might get broken or fake ones snapped off if care isn\\'t taken when opening the top.Also, the diaper disposal mechanism, which is great (!!!) since it really keeps the odor inside the pail, can be a little loud as it slides down into the pail, especially in the quiet hours in the middle of the night when you\\'re trying to get baby back to sleep. Just be sure to dispose of your diaper(s) before putting baby down to sleep.I would recommend this product to everyone, even with these two very minor issues.</th>\n",

If you look at the picture you might understand.  After you flip the handle, the diaper on the inside goes into the bag when the cylinder you place it in is vertical, or completely upside down.  On the sides, there are walls that are snug to the round part that flips around. It is between the round diaper flipper thing and the walls that stuff could potentially get caught.

The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child\\'s point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.  Also, it needs to be away from the wall a little bit, so that it\\'s flip top access lid locks into place and doesn\\'t plop back down, but when engaged, the top will stay open so you can get at the bag of diapers within without having it fall onto your hand.We keep a little can of Oust nearby, spritz it before opening the top, grab the bag at it\\'s neck to close off stinky odors, lift it out, twist it at the top and secure it with a twist-tie, and away we go to the garbage can.

Our baby\\'s room was constantly stinky (due to the Diaper Champ, not the baby!), and we were having to empty the container almost daily.  What\\'s the point of having a diaper disposal system if you can\\'t dispose of diapers efficiently?  Please don\\'t buy this product unless you enjoy smelling those dirty diapers.

It would squish out the sides, making a horrible mess! So I purchased the wide mouth size. More $$! The larger diapers fit a little better, but the monthly cost of special Diaper Genie bags started adding up.With the birth of our second child, I refused to use the Diaper Genie. SO in a search for something better than a smelly garbage can in our baby\\'s room, we found the Diaper Champ.The Diaper Champ out performed the Diaper Genie, not once was the diaper too large to fit in the top of the unit and it was cost effective because it uses your standard trash bags!On trash day, we would open the top pull out the old bag, tie it up, throw in a new one, and out to the corner for trash pickup.Ten years and 3 more kids later, this diaper pail is still the Champ in our house!</th>\n",
